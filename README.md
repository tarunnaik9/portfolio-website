# OverView

The Personal Portfolio Website is a fully interactive platform designed to showcase my skills, projects, and academic journey as a final-year Computer Science student. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website features a responsive design that ensures optimal viewing on both mobile and desktop devices. Key sections include an engaging bio, a detailed skills list, and a showcase of projects with descriptions. The design prioritizes user experience with intuitive navigation and visually appealing elements, reflecting my commitment to front-end development.
